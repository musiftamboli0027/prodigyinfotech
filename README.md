1.[CALCULATOR]:-This code is a simple implementation of a calculator using the Tkinter library in Python. The calculator has a basic GUI with buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), a decimal point, an equals sign (=) for calculation, and a "C" button for clearing the input.
Let's go through the code step by step
Step 1:Import the Tkinter library, which is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Python.
Step 2:Define the on_click function
Step 3:Create the main window
Step 4:Create the entry widget
Step 5:Define the buttons and layout
Step 6:Start the main event loop, allowing the Tkinter application to respond to user interactions.

2.[TO-DO-LIST]:This code is a simple implementation of a To-Do List application using the Tkinter library in Python. The application has a graphical user interface (GUI) with an entry widget for adding tasks, a button to add tasks to the list, a listbox to display the tasks, and a button to remove selected tasks from the list.

3.[PASSWORD GENERATOR]:
This code is a simple Password Generator application using the Tkinter library in Python. The application has a graphical user interface (GUI) with an entry widget to specify the password length, a button to generate a password, and another entry widget to display the generated password. The GUI components are styled using the ttk.Style class for a more colorful appearance.

4.[ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR]:This code is a simple implementation of a Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game using the Tkinter library in Python. The game has a graphical user interface (GUI) where the user can select their choice (rock, paper, or scissors), click a "Play" button to make a choice, and see the result of the game against the computer's randomly chosen move.
